					Authoritarian leaders incorporate key subnational posts into state bureaucratic structures to consolidate their regimes.

					Exploiting a comprehensive dataset of post-tenure careers of governors in Russia, this study demonstrates that under the
					centralisation reforms of the Putin presidency, governors have left their posts at the discretion of the federal
					government. 
          In the 2010s, outgoing governors frequently faced criminal charges. 
          At the same time, an increasing number
					of governors have been promoted to federal government posts, and regional posts have been incorporated into the federal
					administrative structure through a combination of tight control and promotions.

					Ukraine’s 2020 local elections showed a radical transformation of the party system through
					the proliferation of local parties.
					While extant studies have examined the gradual nationalization of the party system, the
					rapid increase in party system localization, as observed in present-day Ukraine, has rarely
					been discussed.
					Combining qualitative evidence on the 2010s’ political processes and quantitative evidence
					from data analysis of Ukraine’s local election results in 2010, 2015, and 2020, this study
					demonstrates that party system localization was caused by influential mayors who rapidly
					accumulated power after the Euromaidan.
					This increase in mayoral authority has three main causes.
					First, institutional settings such as popular mayoral elections and the relative autonomy of
					city governments in the state structure provide mayors with unique powers at odds with other
					regional actors, such as the governors.
					Second, the decentralization reform initiated after the Euromaidan empowered mayors and city
					governments.
					Finally, Volodymyr Zelens’kyi’s recruitment pattern of governors and his party Servant of
					the People’s candidate selection process enabled mayors to cultivate their local power
					bases.
					This study offers an important implication for the idea of patronalism by indicating the
					geographical fragmentation of patronal politics.

							Although much scholarly attention has recently been devoted to authoritarian successor parties, most existing studies
							have not empirically examined the survival patterns of former elite cadres of overthrown regimes. 
              This study explores
							the conditions under which members of former ruling parties survive in the elections that follow the collapse of
							authoritarian regimes. 
              Exploiting the comprehensive data of 450 incumbents of the national legislature and 2869
							incumbents of the regional legislatures in Ukraine, this study examines the survival of the former members of a
							collapsed ruling party, the Party of Regions (PoR), and demonstrates that former PoR deputies with individual resources,
							such as those elected in single-member districts, were more likely to secure seats in the subsequent elections.

							Additionally, electoral calculations prevailed over political programmes or ideologies in terms of party affiliations of
							former PoR deputies. 
              These findings highlight the importance of individual resources of ex-members of authoritarian
							ruling parties in political survival.

							How and under what conditions do authoritarian rulers use the state apparatus to help ensure

							To answer this question, this paper examines electoral mobilization as a rationale for the
							appointment of governors in hybrid regimes.
							Given their absolute authority to use administrative resources, autocratic rulers prefer
							governors who can perform well in mobilizing the electorate in their favor.
							However, several circumstances make this strategy suboptimal or impossible.
							To provide empirical evidence supporting this argument, this study conducts a survival
							analysis using an original dataset of gubernatorial appointments and dismissals in Ukraine
							from 1996 to 2017. The results confirm that electoral performance was the primary driver of
							governor appointments during the presidency of Leonid Kuchma.
							In addition, it is demonstrated that various institutional conditions, such as party
							strength, the weak authority of the ruler within the central government, and regional
							polarization resulted in the adoption of different appointment strategies by subsequent
							presidents.

					Russia’s use of hybrid strategies—combining disinformation, propaganda, and local political alliances—has
					become a
					defining feature of electoral interference in Europe. While existing research has focused on voter
					susceptibility and
					party responses to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, less attention has been paid to the local political
					mechanisms through
					which pro-Russian actors build durable support. This article examines the rise of political organizations
					linked to Ilan
					Șor in Moldova, a case in which pro-Russian mobilization has persisted. Drawing on expert interviews
					conducted in
					Moldova in 2024, the study traces the development of Șor’s network since 2016, focusing on two strategically
					important
					regions: Bălți and Găgăuzia. The article advances four main findings. First, Șor’s political success relies
					primarily on
					systematic vote buying and material inducements rather than ideology alone. Second, economic dissatisfaction
					under the
					pro-European PAS government created opportunities for short-term populist redistribution. Third, judicial
					exclusion
					strategies weakened Șor electorally but intensified polarization without addressing underlying pro-Russian
					grievances.
					Fourth, shifting strategies of the Socialist Party (PSRM) critically shaped both the expansion and
					contraction of Șor’s
					influence. By highlighting how local party competition mediates external influence, the article contributes
					to debates
					on pro-Russian parties, hybrid warfare, and subnational politics in Eastern Europe.

				Why do authoritarian regimes tolerate opposition parties that have little chance of winning power? While
				existing
				research highlights the functions of dominant parties and systemic opposition parties, it overlooks the
				proliferation of
				minor opposition parties in autocracies. Similar to niche parties in democracies, these actors rarely win
				seats but play
				meaningful roles in authoritarian politics. This article argues that minor opposition parties contribute to
				authoritarian resilience through two mechanisms. First, they enhance electoral legitimacy by populating
				ballots and
				symbolically broadening political choice, allowing rulers to claim popular endorsement without relaxing
				control. Second,
				they mitigate electoral uncertainty by fragmenting opposition coalitions, preempting issue ownership, and
				diverting
				votes. Empirically, the study examines Russia since 2012, when party registration liberalisation triggered a
				surge of
				minor parties. Using an original dataset of 367 regional legislative elections (2003–2024), it combines
				statistical and
				qualitative analyses. Regression results show that minor opposition parties are more active in regions with
				lower
				turnout (indicating weaker electoral legitimacy) and weaker regime support (indicating higher uncertainty).
				To bolster
				legitimacy, the Kremlin has encouraged these parties to project pluralism and mobilise participation,
				particularly in
				urban areas. To manage uncertainty, the regime initially relied on "spoiler” parties that imitated major
				opposition
				groups but later shifted to creating minor parties that filled ideological voids and siphoned potential
				opposition
				votes. Descriptive evidence indicates that their presence has effectively curbed the influence of stronger
				opposition
				parties. These findings reveal how minor opposition parties perform symbolic and strategic functions that
				sustain
				authoritarian rule through managed pluralism.

					Cadre Control and Coercion: How Centralized Appointments of Subnational Officials Intensify Judicial Repression.

					Why do some subnational officials in authoritarian regimes initiate judicial repression against local elites? 
          We theorize that political centralization intensifies subnational repression by altering the incentive structures of
					governors and prosecutors. Building on theories of cadre management and bureaucratic control, we argue that officials
					appointed and rotated by the central government face greater career incentives to pursue criminal cases against mayors.
					Using an original dataset of mayoral arrests in Russia (2000–2020), we find that mayors are more likely to face charges
					under appointed governors and outsider prosecutors. While outsider prosecutors selectively target vulnerable mayors, the
					different incentive structure makes governors repress broadly. These findings challenge top-down models of authoritarian
					coercion by showing how centralization facilitates repression from below. The study contributes to research on
					authoritarian institutions, subnational politics, and the bureaucratic foundations of state repression.

								Why do some former regime affiliates survive regime breakdowns while others do not? To answer this, I
								develop an
								electoral trade-off framework for renomination of former regime affiliates. While recruiting these
								affiliates entails
								reputational costs, their mobi- lization capabilities are attractive to new parties. The severity of this
								trade-off
								shapes the strategies of new parties. Using datasets from regional legislative elections before and af- ter
								Ukraine’s
								Euromaidan revolution, the analysis shows that new parties recruited former regime affiliates with higher
								mobilization
								capacity and weaker ties to the former ruling party. Former regime affiliates were more likely to be
								nominated in rural
								districts, where reputation costs are lower and mobilization benefits are higher. These patterns are more
								pronounced in
								the recruitment of the new ruling party than the successor party, due to the different severity of the
								trade-off.

					Subnational Cadre Rotations for Centralization: Different Appointment Patterns of Outsider and Local

					How do autocrats recruit subnational officials? The extant literature asserts that authoritarian rulers
					allow longer
					tenures to loyal subnational officials who can mobilize voters in favor of regimes. This study argues that
					advancing
					centralization is another important motive for subnational cadre rotations. Although autocrats prefer to
					appoint loyal
					agents who conduct subnational policies in favor of the center, the threat of local elite rebellions forces
					autocrats to
					select local strongmen as their delegates. Exploiting the data on governor rotations in Russia, this study
					demonstrates
					that governors without local ties are more likely to be appointed in more democratic regions and regions
					with less
					popular leaders. By contrast, rotations of governors embedded in local communities are determined by the
					dominant
					party’s electoral performance. These findings contribute to an understanding of authoritarian subnational
					cadre
					rotations that seeks to enhance centralization while minimizing the possibility of regional instability.
