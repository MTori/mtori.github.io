        Governing Regions with Outsiders: Subnational Cadre Rotations and Centralization in Post-Soviet Russia

            Although centralization gives autocrats formal power over entire regions of their countries, weak institutions and
            the vast size of the territories prevent them from effectively managing local affairs without the support of local elites.
            This book project sheds light on centralization reforms in Russia and how these reforms have changed the political interactions
            between federal, regional, and local elites.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on information gathered during eleven months of intensive fieldwork in several Russian regions, it is shown that several
            Kremlin agents are struggling to involve local elites in centralization reforms. Statistical analyses of a variety of data, such as
            the career patterns of governors and heads of municipal executives, methods of selecting heads of municipal executives, and election results,
            support the theories presented in the case studies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main findings suggest that informal interactions among local elites play a crucial role even in centralized autocracies.
            Although autocracies successfully centralize power through formal institutional reforms, new informal interactions between central and local governments
            emerge within the framework of the new institutions.

              On a campaign poster of an incumbent mayor of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, someone put a sticker saying
              “Eдим Poccию (We eat Russia.)” instead of “Eдиная Poccия (United Russia).” The bear in the original United Russia logo was replaced by a mouse.
